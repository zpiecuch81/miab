				<H2>FAQ</H2>
			</header>
			<ol>
				<li>Can I destroy my bottle?
				<br>No, but if you will be the first person that finds it, then no one else will get it.</li>
				<li>How many people will get my bottle?
				<br>Each bottle can be taken only once.</li>
				<li>How long will my bottle be "active"?
				<br>Once bottle is left, it's there till someone finds it.</li>
				<li>What's the difference between hidden and left bottles?
				<br>Left bottles are automatically found when searching bottles is enabled.
				Hidden bottles can be found only by pressing "Search hidden bottles". Pressing "Search hidden bottles" all the time can be uncomfortable, therefore hidden bottles are much harder to find (in practice, almost impossible when you don't know where to search).</li>
				<li>Can you tell who left specific bottle?
				<br>No. Once bottle is left, there is no connection to its creator in MIABs database. If you like you can write your email, name, facebook data etc.</li>
				<li>Can I track my bottle?
				<br>No. Once bottle is left there is no connection to its creator, so it can't be tracked.</li>
				<li>What is the direction and speed of thrown bottles?
				<br>Speed and direction of flowing is generated at the moment of throwing a bottle.</li>
				<li>Are messages encrypted?
				<br>No.</li>
				<li>Can I use the program inside buildings?
				<br>Generally yes. However because GPS accuracy is low, it might be impossible to leave bottles inside buildings. </li>
				<li>Why do I need to have GPS enabled?
				<br>Location is needed to leave bottles in proper place. Also when looking for bottles location is required. GPS data are not used to anything else.</li>
				<li>I left a bottle and next day I can't find it in the same place. Why?
				<br>First: it is possible that someone else already found it. Second: although we follow the best practices when gathering GPS data, accuracy of GPS systems varies depending on weather, producer and other parameters. Unfortunately this may cause the bottle to be in slightly different position than you think you left it. Consider checking circle area with up to 10 meter radius.</li>
