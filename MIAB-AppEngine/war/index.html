			<h4>Leaving bottles</h4>
			Left bottle stays in current location till someone finds it.
			To leave a bottle choose "Leave a bottle" option on main screen. Write message on next screen and press "Leave bottle" button at the bottom.
			<h4>Throwing bottles</h4>
			Thrown bottle flows through the world till someone finds it.
			To throw a bottle choose "Throw a bottle" option on main screen. Write message on next screen and press "Throw bottle" button at the bottom.
			<h4>Hiding bottles</h4>
			Hidden bottle stays in current location till someone finds it.
			To hide a bottle choose "Hide a bottle" option on main screen. Write message on next screen and press "Hide bottle" button at the bottom.
			<h4>Searching bottles</h4>
			Searching flowing and left bottles is done automatically by the program. When searching bottles is enabled it's enough to walk. To enable/disable searching bottles, press the lighthouse image in top-right corner of the screen.
			<br>Image of lighthouse with light beams means that searching bottles is enabled.
			<br>Image of lighthouse without light beams means that searching bottles is disabled.
			<br><b><i>Please notice that searching for bottles works even when Message In A Bottle is not visible on the screen.</i></b>
			<h4>Searching hidden bottles</h4>
			To find hidden bottle(s), press "Search hidden bottles" button on main screen of the application. Searching will happen at current location, at it will be performed only once. If you would like to search in other location you need to press "Search hidden bottles" button again while you are in that location. This procedure makes finding hidden bottles harder, so even though everyone can find it, it's very difficult when you don't know where to search.
			<h4>Viewing found bottles</h4>
			To view found bottles, press "Found bottles" button on main screen of the application. If you have found any bottles, they will be listed there. To see read bottles' message just tap it. 
			<h4>Delete found bottles</h4>
			To delete found bottles tap it and hold for a while. From the menu choose "Delete bottle". Deleted bottle can not be recovered.

				<H2>FAQ</H2>
			</header>
			<ol>
				<li>Can I destroy my message?
				<br>No, but if you will be the first person that finds it, then no one else will get it.</li>
				<li>How many people will get my message?
				<br>Each message can be taken only once.</li>
				<li>How long will my message be "active"?
				<br>Once message is left, it's there till someone finds it.</li>
				<li>What's the difference between hidden and left bottles?
				<br>Left bottles are automatically found when searching bottles is enabled.
				Hidden bottles can be found only by pressing "Search hidden bottles". Pressing "Search hidden bottles" all the time can be uncomfortable, therefore hidden bottles are much harder to find (in practice, almost impossible when you don't know where to search).</li>
				<li>Can you tell who left specific message?
				<br>No. Once message is left, there is no connection to its creator in MIABs database. If you like you can write your email, name, facebook data etc.</li>
				<li>Can I track my message?
				<br>No. Once message is left there is no connection to its creator, so it can't be tracked.</li>
				<li>What is the direction and speed of thrown bottles?
				<br>Speed and direction of flowing is generated at the moment of throwing a bottle.</li>
				<li>Are messages encrypted?
				<br>No.</li>
				<li>Can I use the program inside buildings?
				<br>Generally yes. However because GPS accuracy is low, it might be impossible to leave bottles inside buildings. </li>
				<li>Why do I need to have GPS enabled?
				<br>Location is needed to leave bottles in proper place. Also when looking for bottles location is required. GPS data are not used to anything else.</li>
				<li>I left a message and next day I can't find it in the same place. Why?
				<br>First: it is possible that someone else already found it. Second: although we follow the best practices when gathering GPS data, accuracy of GPS systems varies depending on weather, producer and other parameters. Unfortunately this may cause the message to be in slightly different position than you think you left it. Consider checking circle area with up to 10 meter radius.</li>
